    "## Comparison and Assignment Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous lessons, you used arithmetic operators such as `+` to add values, but there are many other operators in `Python` that allow you to work with values.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will work with comparison operators, which allow you to compare values such as checking whether one value is greater than another (e.g. `>`). \n",
    "\n",
    "With comparison operators, you can compare whether a value or variable is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `>` greater than \n",
    "* `>=` greater than or equal to\n",
    "* `<` less than\n",
    "* `<=` less than or equal to\n",
    "* `==` equal to\n",
    "* `=!` not equal to \n",
    "\n",
    "another value or variable that follows the operator. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will also work with assignment operators (e.g. `+=`), which allow you to set a variable to a new value based on an arithmetic operation or some other calculation. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point in the course, you have already used assignment operators to add items to `Python` lists, such as when you added a new item for December to a list containing month names (e.g. `months += [\"Dec\"]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Looping Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "In `Python`, there are two primary structures for loops: `while` and `for`. You will learn about both in this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "### While Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "A `while` loop is used to iteratively execute code until a certain condition is met. That condition could be that the results of the code reach a certain value (e.g. code will iteratively execute as long as the current value of the results is less than 5). \n",
    "\n",
    "For `while` loops, comparison and assignment operators are both very useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can write a loop to iteratively add a value of `1` to a variable `x` using `x += 1`, as long as the current value of `x` does not exceed a specified value."

    "1. First, you indicate the condition after the word `while` \n",
    "2. Then, you finish the condition with a colon `:`\n",
    "3. Last, you indent the code lines that are included in the `while` loop. **This indentation is important** in `Python` as it indicates that the indented code is to be executed as part of the loop, not after the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a comparison operator is used to compare the value of variable `x` (which begins with value of `0`) to the value `10`, the designated end point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the loop, the value of `x` is printed first, before the assignment operator is used to add a value of `1` to `x`. This process repeats each time that the code iterates, until the current value of `x` is no longer less than `10`.\n",
    "\n",
